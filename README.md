# Intelligent Academic Assistant

The Intelligent Academic Assistant is a web-based application that uses Large Language Models to help students answer academic questions, summarize long texts, and understand concepts through an interactive Streamlit interface.

## Overview
The Intelligent Academic Assistant is a web-based application designed to help students interact with academic content more effectively. Traditional learning resources are often static and difficult to navigate, making it challenging for students to quickly understand complex topics, summarize lengthy materials, or ask contextual questions. This project addresses these challenges by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into an interactive academic support system.

## Objectives
- Answer academic questions accurately
- Summarize long academic texts
- Explain concepts at different difficulty levels
- Enable interactive human–AI communication
- Demonstrate practical application of LLMs in education

## Key Features
- Academic question answering
- Text summarization
- Concept explanation (beginner to advanced)
- Key point extraction
- Streamlit-based interactive web interface
- Secure API key handling using environment variables
- Cloud deployment using Streamlit Community Cloud

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Hugging Face Inference API
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Prompt Engineering
